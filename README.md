# PloitKit
The Hacker's ToolBox

PloitKit is a Python based GUI tool designed as one-stop for all other softwares. I was facing these kinds of problem, when I need to switch to different system, or I lost my pen-drive. I have to go to google, and search every tool and download every tool and so on. So I decided to create a tool, in which I just click and click and tool is there.

I have added more than 900+ tools in this tool, but only 400+ is available now, to test will this tool work, if it works I'll make it available for everyone.

# Features

1. Auto-Update - No need to come over here, and look for new version every time.
2. Better Error Handling - Some tools may cause error, that's why I added this option.
3. Graphical Interface - For just click & click.
4. Malware Protectiong - All tools are downloaded from their original source, so no malwares or any viruses.
5. Multi-Platform - Many tools are for designed differently for Mac, Windows & Linux, so I added option for that. Choose your platform and you're good to go.
6. Better organised - Everything is better organised nothing like search everything, and all that mess.

I believe that, nothing can't be perfect, So I added option to report a tool, or send me suggestions about any new tool, I should add.

# Contributions
